    <div id="aboutTikTokBan" class="content">
        <p>The bill President Biden signed gave TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, 270 days to sell TikTok or face a ban. The original deadline was January 19, 2025, at midnight. If ByteDance didn’t sell TikTok, app stores and internet providers would have to block the app, making it unusable in the U.S.</p>
        <p>However, two days before the deadline, President Biden announced he wouldn’t enforce the ban and decided to leave the decision to President-elect Trump. On January 18, 2025, TikTok proactively shut down its services in the U.S. before the government enforced the ban.</p>
        <p>President-elect Trump then announced plans to issue an executive order extending the deadline by 90 days. This means TikTok has until April 19, 2025, to complete a sale or face a ban. TikTok has since started restoring its services for U.S. users.</p>
        <p>ByteDance now has a limited window to find a buyer, while content creators scramble to prepare for the platform’s uncertain future.</p>

    <div id="aboutTikTokBanTimer" class="content">
        <p>The timer represents the original January 19, 2025, midnight deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok. Despite this deadline, TikTok chose to shut down its services in the U.S. on January 18, 2025, preemptively, to avoid any legal enforcement issues. This created confusion since the timer is still counting down.</p>
        <p>President-elect Trump’s announcement of a 90-day extension gives ByteDance until April 19, 2025, to find a buyer. While the current timer reflects the original deadline, future updates will include the new deadline if the executive order is finalized.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, TikTok has begun restoring services for U.S. users, but its long-term future remains uncertain as the countdown continues toward its new deadline.</p>

    <div id="whyIsTikTokBad" class="content">
        <p>Recent reports have highlighted several concerns regarding TikTok's impact on users, especially among younger demographics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mental Health Risks:</strong> Studies indicate that TikTok's algorithm can expose users to harmful content, including topics related to eating disorders and self-harm, potentially exacerbating mental health issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Privacy Concerns:</strong> Lawsuits allege that TikTok has been aware of the risks children face on its platform, including the potential misuse of personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotion of Harmful Challenges:</strong> The platform has been linked to dangerous viral challenges, such as the "blackout challenge," which have resulted in serious injuries and fatalities among young users.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithmic Influence:</strong> Investigations reveal that TikTok's algorithm may push harmful content to teens every 39 seconds, raising concerns about the platform's content moderation practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Propaganda and Manipulation:</strong> TikTok's algorithm has been criticized for promoting divisive and harmful content while suppressing educational and unifying material. Some experts believe this strategy aims to exploit societal weaknesses and polarize communities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In China, TikTok’s counterpart, Douyin, promotes educational and patriotic content, while the version used in the U.S. frequently highlights trends and challenges that are less constructive. This stark difference has led to accusations that the platform manipulates societies differently depending on their geopolitical significance.</p>
