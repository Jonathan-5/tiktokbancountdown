    <div id="aboutTikTokBan" class="content">
        <p>The bill President Biden signed gave TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, 270 days to sell TikTok or face a ban. The original deadline was January 19, 2025, at midnight. If ByteDance didn’t sell TikTok, app stores and internet providers would have to block the app, making it unusable in the U.S.</p>

        <p>However, two days before the deadline, President Biden announced he wouldn’t enforce the ban and decided to leave the decision to President-elect Trump. On January 18, 2025, TikTok proactively shut down its services in the U.S. before the government enforced the ban.</p>

        <p>President-elect Trump then announced plans to issue an executive order extending the deadline by 90 days. This means TikTok has until April 19, 2025, to complete a sale or face a ban. TikTok has since started restoring its services for U.S. users.</p>

        <p>ByteDance now has a limited window to find a buyer, while content creators scramble to prepare for the platform’s uncertain future.</p>

    <div id="aboutTikTokBanTimer" class="content">
        <p>The timer represents the original January 19, 2025, midnight deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok. Despite this deadline, TikTok chose to shut down its services in the U.S. on January 18, 2025, preemptively, to avoid any legal enforcement issues. This created confusion since the timer is still counting down.</p>

        <p>President-elect Trump’s announcement of a 90-day extension gives ByteDance until April 19, 2025, to find a buyer. While the current timer reflects the original deadline, future updates will include the new deadline if the executive order is finalized.</p>

        <p>In the meantime, TikTok has begun restoring services for U.S. users, but its long-term future remains uncertain as the countdown continues toward its new deadline.</p>
